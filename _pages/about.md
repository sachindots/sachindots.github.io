I'm Sachin, an aspiring Analyst with a passion for Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence. Alongside my experience as a freelance Penetration Tester at IP Security Labs and Operations Coordinator at ATmega Software Technologies LLP, where I managed operations and implemented cybersecurity measures, I’ve always had a strong interest in Machine Learning on Cybersecurity Domain.

In my independent research, I focus on AI-Driven Cybersecurity, and I’ve built projects like a Machine Learning-based Firewall and a CNN-powered Malware Detection system. These experiences have sharpened my skills in both data analysis and AI, which I’m eager to apply in an analyst role.

Currently, I’m actively seeking opportunities in ML Tech where I can blend my analytical mindset with my hands-on experience in cybersecurity and AI, while continuing my research.
