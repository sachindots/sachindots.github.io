ðŸ’» Iâ€™m Sachin, working as an AI-focused Python Developer, with experience across VAPT (Cyraacs Internship) and freelance penetration testing (IP Security Labs). I also served as Operations Coordinator at ATmega Software Technologies, where I supported projects and security integration.

ðŸ”’ My core interest lies in Cybersecurity & AIâ€”Iâ€™ve built projects like an ML-based Firewall and CNN-powered Malware Detection, and Iâ€™m now seeking opportunities in cybersecurity analysis, pentesting, and AI-driven defense.

ðŸ“Œ Long-term, I aim to move into research on AI-driven cybersecurity solutions to tackle evolving digital threats.
