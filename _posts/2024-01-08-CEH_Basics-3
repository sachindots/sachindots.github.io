In this blog, we’ll explore **network scanning**, a must have skill for an Ethical Hacker. By understanding the various scanning techniques and methods, you’ll gain a deeper insight into identifying live hosts, open ports, and services within a network. These techniques are vital for assessing potential vulnerabilities and planning robust defenses.

### **What Is Network Scanning?**  

**Network Scanning** is the process of probing a network to identify active hosts, open ports, and services. It is often the first step in the reconnaissance phase of ethical hacking or penetration testing. Tools like **Nmap, Hping3, Metasploit, and NetScanTools Pro** are commonly used for scanning to:  
- Discover live systems.  
- Detect open ports and running services.  
- Gather details about the network layout and vulnerabilities.

### **Types of Scans Explained**  

#### 1. **Host Discovery Scans**  
Used to identify active or live systems in a network. This scan determines which devices are reachable and responding to requests.  

##### **Common Techniques:**  
- **ICMP Ping Scan:**  
  Sends ICMP Echo Requests to check if a host is live. Examples:  
  - Single Target: `nmap -sn -PE (target)`  
  - Sweep Across IP Range: `nmap -sn -PE (IP Range)`  

  Tools: **Angry IP Scanner, SolarWinds Engineer's Toolset, Advanced IP Scanner**  

- **UDP Ping Scan:**  
  Probes devices using UDP packets instead of ICMP. Command: `nmap -sn -PU (target)`  

- **TCP SYN Ping:**  
  Initiates a TCP handshake to detect live hosts. Command: `nmap -sn -PS (target)`  

- **IP Protocol Ping Scan:**  
  Probes devices for specific IP protocols to identify live hosts. Command: `nmap -sn -PO (target)`  

---

#### 2. **Port Scanning**  
Identifies open ports on a target system and the services running on those ports. Different scanning methods can determine whether ports are open, closed, or filtered by firewalls.  

##### **Techniques:**  

- **TCP Connect/Full Open Scan:**  
  Completes the **three-way handshake** to determine if a port is open.  
  - Command: `nmap -sT -v (target)`  
  - Advantage: Reliable and straightforward.  
  - Disadvantage: Easily detectable by firewalls and logging systems.  

- **Stealth Scanning (Half-Open Scan):**  
  Aborts the handshake before completion, making it harder to detect.  
  - Command: `nmap -sS -v (target)`  
  - Purpose: Evades logging mechanisms by keeping connections "half-open."  

- **Inverse TCP Flag Scans:**  
  Uses unusual TCP flags to infer the port state. Examples include:  
  - **FIN Scan:** Sends packets with the FIN flag. Command: `nmap -sF -v (target)`  
  - **Xmas Scan:** Sends packets with FIN, PSH, and URG flags set. Command: `nmap -sX -v (target)`  
  - **Null Scan:** Sends packets with no flags set. Command: `nmap -sN -v (target)`  

- **UDP Scanning:**  
  Probes UDP ports to find open ones. Less reliable due to firewall blocking and packet loss.  
  - Command: `nmap -sU -v (target)`  

- **Third-Party Scans:**  
  Involves using another host as a "zombie" to conduct scans, such as an **Idle/IPID Header Scan.**  
  - Command: `nmap -Pn -p -sI (Zombie Host) (target)`  

---

#### 3. **Service Discovery**  
Identifies the specific services and versions running on open ports.  
- Command: `nmap -sV (target)`  
- Purpose: Helps in finding software vulnerabilities based on service versions.  

---

#### 4. **OS Discovery (Banner Grabbing)**  
Determines the operating system of a target host through responses to specially crafted packets.  

##### **Techniques:**  
- **Active Banner Grabbing:**  
  - Sends custom packets to provoke responses that reveal OS details.  
  - Command: `nmap -O (target)`  

- **Passive Banner Grabbing:**  
  - Observes error messages, network traffic, or file extensions to infer OS.  
  - Example: `.aspx` suggests an IIS server on Windows.

### **Advanced Evasion Techniques**  

To bypass firewalls or Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), attackers use these methods:  

- **Packet Fragmentation:** Breaks data into smaller fragments to evade detection.  
  - Command: `nmap -f (target)`  

- **Source Port Manipulation:** Spoofs traffic from trusted ports (e.g., HTTP or DNS).  
  - Command: `nmap -g 80 (target)`  

- **IP Address Decoy:** Generates multiple fake IP addresses to confuse IDS.  
  - Command: `nmap -D decoy1,decoy2 (target)`  

- **Bad Checksums:** Sends packets with invalid checksums to evade firewalls.  
  - Command: `nmap --badsum (target)`

### **Countermeasures for Scanning**  

#### Host Discovery Countermeasures:  
- Block incoming ICMP Echo Requests from untrusted sources.  
- Deploy IDS systems like Snort to detect and block ping sweeps.  

#### Port Scanning Countermeasures:  
- Use firewalls to detect and block unauthorized probes.  
- Limit open ports to essential services only.  

#### Banner Grabbing Countermeasures:  
- Disable or mask banners to hide OS and service information.  
- Turn off unnecessary services on hosts.  

#### General Countermeasures:  
- Use cryptographic protocols (e.g., IPsec, SSH) to encrypt traffic.  
- Implement multi-layered defenses with firewalls and IDS.
