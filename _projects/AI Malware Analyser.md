## Malware Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

The **Malware Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks** project aims to address the limitations of traditional antivirus systems, which rely on signature-based identifiers that struggle with newly emerging malware. This project leverages CNNs and deep learning techniques to detect malware efficiently, enabling real-time identification of threats.

### Technologies Used:

#### Backend
- **Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, Flask

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: Flask, Bootstrap 5

### Dataset

- **Name**: Malimg dataset from Kaggle
  - The dataset consists of 9,339 malware images belonging to 25 different families. Each sample contains the hexadecimal representation of a binary file, which is converted into a PNG image for input to the CNN model.

### System Methodology

#### System Architecture

The system consists of several modules working together to detect malware:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Collect samples from Kaggle.
2. **Data Pre-processing**: Convert binary files into image representations.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features for training.
4. **Model Training**: Train the CNN model using processed data.
5. **Prediction**: Classify new samples as malware or benign.
6. **Web Interface**: Provide user interaction via a Flask-based interface.

### Data Pre-processing

Malware samples are processed to convert binary files into images:

- Example byte sequence:  `E4 C0 56 A3 D2 78 56 A3 FF`

- Each value in the sequence is converted to grayscale values (0-255), forming an image. This results in images of size 128x128 for each malware sample.

### Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new variables from raw data to improve the model's performance. High-quality features significantly enhance the accuracy of machine learning models.

### Model Training

Training involves running the input data through the model to correlate the output with the sample output. The CNN architecture consists of:

- **Convolutional Layers**: 30 filters (3x3) and 15 filters (3x3)
- **Pooling Layers**: Max pooling (2x2)
- **Dropout Layers**: Drop 25% of neurons to prevent overfitting
- **Dense Layers**: 128 neurons with ReLU, 50 neurons with Softmax, output layer with `num_class` neurons (Softmax)

### Creating the CNN

The CNN architecture is designed based on the best parameters:

- Input shape: [64x64x3] (RGB image)
- Two hidden layers, multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Flatten layer for transforming the output into a single vector
- Fully connected layers for classification

### Prediction

The trained model predicts whether an executable file is malware or benign, providing fast and accurate results.

### Web Interface using Flask

The Flask-based web interface allows users to upload an executable file for real-time malware detection:

- Flask handles web server requests and integrates with the trained model
- The web interface enables user interaction and result visualization

2. **Integration with Antivirus Software**  
 - Enhance existing antivirus solutions with the model's capabilities.
3. **Additional Features**  
 - Add behavior analysis and network traffic monitoring.
4. **User Interface Improvements**  
 - Enhance the web interface for a better user experience.
