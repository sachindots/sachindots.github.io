The **Malware Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks** project aims to improve traditional antivirus systems by leveraging CNN-based deep learning techniques to detect newly updated malware efficiently. The project is designed to identify whether an executable file is malicious or benign using a CNN model built with TensorFlow.

### Backend
- **Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, Flask

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Flask

### Dataset
- **Name**: Malimg dataset from Kaggle
  - Consists of 9,339 malware images across 25 families. The dataset is used to perform multi-class classification of malware by converting binary files to images.

### System Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition**: Collected malware samples from Kaggle.
2. **Data Pre-processing**: Converted malware binary files into images.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extracted features from images for training.
4. **Model Training**: Trained a CNN model with the pre-processed data.
5. **Prediction**: Used the trained model to classify new malware samples.
6. **Web Interface**: Created a Flask-based web interface for user interaction and result visualization.

### Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Feature extraction with filters and kernel size adjustments.
- **Pooling Layers**: Dimensionality reduction using max-pooling.
- **Dropout Layers**: Preventing overfitting by dropping neurons.
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for classification.

### Prediction and Results
The model predicts whether a given file is malware or benign with high accuracy. Results are displayed on a user-friendly web interface.

### Future Enhancements
- **Real-Time Detection**: Implement real-time malware detection.
- **Integration with Antivirus Software**: Enhance detection capabilities.
- **Behavior Analysis**: Incorporate features like network monitoring.
